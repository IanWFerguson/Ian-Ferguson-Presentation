				<h2> Grean Tree Initiative</h2>

					<p> 
					As all of the conversation about climate change and humans ruining the planet is stronger than ever, we find ourselves at GC revisiting the way we harvest and produce our coffee.  Thus our "brain child" GreanTree Initiative was created.  GreanTree Initiave is our way to give back to the planet and keep this big ball rolling, or spinning. 
					<!-- <b>Sample Text</b>Even though we are a group of people that don't roast their coffee, that doesn't mean we dont know how!  Roasting coffee is very important for developing flavors and aromas.  It's also a fun experiment.  At Grean Coffee, we will teach you how to roast your own coffee from start to finish. -->

						Grean Tree Initiative works as a donation with benefits.  For every pound of coffee you order, you get to plant a tree. You can pick our natural unroasted "Grean" coffee, or you can choose to have your coffee roasted to order.  You have the option to choose from a selection of tree species that are highly endangered and near extinction.  Giving you the feel good feeling of enjoying your hand roasted coffee in the morning, realizing that with every sip, you are saving an ecosystem, one seed at a time <span><b>Learn More ></b></span>
